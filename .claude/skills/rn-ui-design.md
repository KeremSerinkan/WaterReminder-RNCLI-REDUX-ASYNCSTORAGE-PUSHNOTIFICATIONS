name: rn-ui-design
description: Design and build distinctive, production-grade React Native interfaces with sophistication, coherence, and strong visual identity. Use this skill when the user asks for mobile UI, components, screens, flows, or full application design — especially when they want polished, modern, non-generic aesthetics.

This skill produces **high-quality React Native UI** that feels intentionally designed — not autogenerated.

It prioritizes:
- usability
- visual character
- strong hierarchy
- pixel-level craft
- performance on real devices

Code should be realistic and maintainable (TypeScript preferred), and align with how experienced mobile engineers work.

The user describes the goal (screen, feature, flow, app). You respond by clarifying the vision (if needed), proposing a concept, and implementing thoughtful UI.

## 1️⃣ Design Mindset — Before Writing Any Code

Always slow down and think:

### ✔ Purpose
- What task must the user complete?
- Where and how are they using it? (on the go, one-handed, quick interaction, longer session)
- What is success for this screen?

### ✔ Audience
- Beginners, power users, seniors, athletes, kids, professionals?
- Accessibility or contrast requirements?

### ✔ Platform Sensibility
Respect iOS + Android expectations — but don’t be afraid to introduce taste.

### ✔ Aesthetic Direction
Commit to a bold concept:

- luxury + refined
- cinematic dark
- playful + toy-like
- editorial / magazine
- soft pastel wellness
- industrial utilitarian
- brutalist raw
- retro-futuristic
- clean minimal with depth

Pick ONE. Execute it all the way through.

### ✔ Differentiation
Ask yourself:

> “What is the one detail that makes this UI memorable?”

A motion moment, typography choice, card style, contrast pattern — something unique and coherent.

## 2️⃣ Implementation Principles

All designs should be:

- **Production-ready**
- **Consistent**
- **Intentionally spaced**
- **Readable**
- **Performant**
- **Extensible**

Prefer:
- TypeScript
- Styled components or theme systems
- Atomic / modular components
- Reusable typography + spacing scales

Avoid:
- huge inline styles
- random magic numbers
- visual noise
- unnecessary complexity

---

## 3️⃣ Visual & Aesthetic Guidelines

### 🎨 Typography
Choose fonts that have character AND remain readable.

- Establish type hierarchy (Display → Title → Body → Caption).
- Maintain consistent letter-spacing + line-height.
- Avoid generic defaults (unless intentionally minimal).

### 🌈 Color & Theme
Commit to a palette.

- Primary tone
- Accent tone
- Background layers (depth)
- Semantic colors (success, warning, danger)

Use tokens / theme variables for consistency.

Avoid cliché purple gradients unless it is thematically correct.

### ✨ Motion & Micro-interaction
Motion should communicate meaning, not just look pretty.

Use:
- subtle easing on press
- content reveal stagger animations
- transitions between states
- meaningful feedback

Prefer Reanimated / Moti when needed.
Avoid over-animating.

### 📐 Layout & Ergonomics
Design for thumbs and real hands.

- Avoid putting key actions far top corners.
- Respect safe areas, notches, keyboards.
- Maintain breathing room — or intentional density when needed.

### 🌌 Atmosphere & Detail
Create depth and mood:

- gradient meshes
- subtle grain/noise
- translucency + blur layers
- meaningful shadows
- interesting cards + dividers

Everything must serve the concept — never decorative randomness.

### 🧩 Icons & Assets
- Choose icon sets that match tone (outline, filled, geometric, playful).
- Keep stroke weights consistent.
- Customize size — don’t rely on defaults.
- Suggest icons when helpful.

---

## 4️⃣ Coding Guidelines (React Native)

- Use `TypeScript`
- Break large screens into composable UI pieces
- Prefer clean component names
- Keep logic separated from presentation when possible

Support:
- dark mode (where relevant)
- states: loading, empty, success, error
- accessibility: roles, labels, contrast

---

## 5️⃣ What To Avoid (Very Important)

This skill must **not** generate:

- generic AI-looking UIs
- Inter / Roboto / system fonts everywhere (unless intentional)
- default card lists with rounded rectangles everywhere
- tired purple gradient hero sections
- repeating the same look across projects
- cluttered shadows and neon noise
- mismatched icon styles

Every project should feel bespoke and context-aware.

---

## 6️⃣ Complexity vs Vision

Match the build to the idea.

- Maximalist → richer layers, bold visual narrative, motion storytelling
- Minimalist → restraint, precision, impeccable spacing, clarity

Elegance is not about adding more —
it is about designing with intention.

---

### Final Reminder

This skill should think like a **mobile product designer + frontend engineer combined**:

- Understand the problem
- Pick a strong visual direction
- Design with taste
- Implement realistically
- Polish until everything feels intentional
